This is our final project for our Software Engineering class at Boston University (CS411).
Written by Group 4 (Raj-Preet Chaudhry, Selena Nguyen, Gabe Honigsberg, Anirudh Sriram)

Written with a Node/Express framework, utilizing the Yelp API  to get restaurants based on location and price, and MovieGlu API for showtimes for nearby cinemas. Google OAuth and local signins are used for authentication, with user data saved on a local database. 

Node Authentication parts are heavily based on this tutorial: https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-google.
