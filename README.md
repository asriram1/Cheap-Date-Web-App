# Cheap Date.
This is our final project for our Software Engineering class at Boston University (CS411).
Written by Group 4 (Raj-Preet Chaudhry, Selena Nguyen, Gabe Honigsberg, Anirudh Sriram)

Written with a Node/Express framework, utilizing the Yelp API  to get restaurants based on location and price, and MovieGlu API for showtimes for nearby cinemas. Google OAuth and local signins are used for authentication, with user data saved on a local database. 

The app takes in a location and price, and recommends a cinema nearby as well, for a "Cheap Date." of dinner and a movie.

Node Authentication parts are heavily based on this tutorial: https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-google. 

This repo contains the final version of the app. We had issues during development implementing version control through Webstorm, so we had to create brand new repos whenever there were large changes made. For the very first version refer to this link: https://github.com/RajChaudhry/CS411Group4 , for the second: https://github.com/RajChaudhry/CS411Group4new , and this is the third and final one.
