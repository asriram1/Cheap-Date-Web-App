1. As a user I want to be able to login using my Google account, as a guest, or as a new account for the app:
I will be presented a Google login box or app login box, based on my selection, which reappear with an error message if the login attempts fail. Logging in will allow me to search, save and view saved dates. If I don’t want to login, I can select to use the app as a guest/create my own account. Upon login (or continuing as guest), I will be presented with my search box, with search options.
At the top right of the app I have access to a button which is linked to my user profile. Clicking on this will take me to my user profile, which has information about my profile such as name.

2. As a user I should be able to search for a date depending on what I’m looking for.
Upon logging in, or proceeding forward as a guest, I will be presented with list of search criteria. This includes a MM/DD/YYYY format of date or range, along with the preferred time of day and range. Below that is:
* The budget, represented in dollars, indicating how much I am willing to spend for the date.
* The location (either manually entered or detected) and range of travel.
* Movie options, including length and genre
* Meal options, including types of food.
After hitting the search button, I will be presented with a list of possible dates, ranked from top to bottom based on similarity to my search factors. Each search result appears as “Meal, Event”, where all possible meal options are clustered together, and all event options are also clustered together. The corresponding titles, time, price, and other important data also appear below in smaller font.

3. As a user, it should be easy for me to see more detailed information on a potential date idea (meal, movie, etc.)
After selecting a specific date from either the list of search results or saved dates, a drop down window will appear with more information on that date.
The window will include:
*A map, showing travel from my current location, to dinner, movie or event.
