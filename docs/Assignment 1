Idea 1: Cheap Date

Our first idea provides a solution for college students, who are broke, but still want
to plan a great date on a budget. Given a userâ€™s budget and location, our application
will plan a dinner and a movie. It will determine which dinner and movie combination
is best based on price, time, location, and reviews. If travel is required, the application
will consider this when evaluating the cost and timing of a potential date. We would utilize the RottenTomatoes, Yelp/Grubhub, and the Uber/Lyft API's for this project, utilizing OAuth for accounts with either Facebook or Google, and a database saving user's favorite "date spots".

Idea 2: The Personalized Travel Planner

An idea that will resonate with the greater public is that of a personalized travel planner. Although there
do currently exist travel planners on the market, most of these are focused on just one aspect of the trip,
namely the hotels and the flights. The personalized travel planner will enable an end-to-end planning of your trip,
which starts at your doorstep, covers the entirety of your travel, and ends where the trip started- your home.
It will comprise of planning which includes travel to the airport, the flights, hotel/apartments at the destination,
as well as an activity plan in the given city. All of the above will be enabled through a budget specified by the client. We would utilize multiple API's, including Yelp/Grubhub, KAYAK, Uber/Lyft, and other related travel API's. OAuth would be utilized with user profiles via Facebook or Google. Databases would be used to save favorite trips, or favorite destinations per user.
