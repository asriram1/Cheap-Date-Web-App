We decided to use a typical MVC architecture for creating this web-app. We utilize a Node-Express stack with both Pug and EJS serving as the view. Node-Express apps were provided as examples during lecture, and it is one that one of our team members had experience in, so we decided to use this stack. Additionally, this same member has experience using EJS, while the default view engine in the Webstorm IDE is Pug, so we utilized both of these.
